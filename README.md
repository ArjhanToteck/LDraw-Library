# What Is This?
This is an unofficial repository to hold all of the models from [LDraw](https://www.ldraw.org/) in both their native .DAT format as well as in the .STL format for easier manipulation and 3D printing.

# Updating the Repository
The repository can be updated by running updateLibrary.sh in the scripts directory. This will load any updates from LDraw's website and convert any new or updated models into .STL files.
